## Metro Simulator
**MetroSimulator** is a mini Metro Simulator application I made with the purpose of expanding my understanding of GUIs and applying my knowledge to a fun topic I encounter every day.

## Background
Living in DC, you take the metro every day! Struggling with understanding how many stops are between my start and end station, I created this mini Metro Simulator application which allows a user to find out how many stops are between any 2 stations.

The simulator only includes the orange, red, and blue lines given the sheer number of stations in the real DC metro.

## How to run the program

Upon running `MetroSimulator`, a user is able to select their start and end stations through an interactive GUI before being provided with how many stops they must take to reach their destination.
1. **Simply clone the repository:**
   
   git clone https://github.com/dandob1/Metro_Simulator.git

   cd into the folder

   Use the following command:

    - **Windows/Mac:**
