Living in DC you take the metro every day! Struggling with understanding how many stops are between my start and end station, I created this mini Metro Simulator application which allows a user to find out how many stops are between any 2 stations.

The simulator only includes the orange, red and blue lines given the sheer number of stations in the real DC metro. The purpose of this project was to expand upon my understanding of GUI's and apply my knowledge to a fun topic I encounter every day!

Upon running the MetroSimulator file, a user is able to select their start and end stations through an interactive GUI before being provided with how many stops they must take to reach their destination.

The commands necessary to run my program after cloning into the repository are included below: 

javac MetroSimulator.java

and 

java MetroSimulator
